# Kaggle as the platform for running Jupyter Notebooks

Kaggle is a cloud platform originally offering free services for machine learning. However it also allow user to create kernels that run Jupyter Notebooks.
We will look into how Kaggle can be used as the alternative platform (as opposed to Microsft's Azure or eResearch's NeCTAR Research Cloud platform) for
running Jupyter Notebooks.

### Register an account in Kaggle

Go to https://www.kaggle.com/ and click on "Register". Then choose "Register with Google". Since the university mail system is integrated with google, you can
simply use your "upi@aucklanduni.ac.nz" to register.

You will then be redirected to a UoA page for authentication.  Once it's done, the next step is to make up your Username in Kaggle. By default, Kaggle will set your Username the same as your Display name. I highly recommend to manually change your Username" to the UPI (by clicking on the edit button). It will make it easier for other UoA members to locate you since Username is a unique identifier in Kaggle.
